            <p>ReactJS is the widely used frontend framework, and JSON Web Token, JWT for short, is the most used authentication protocol on the web. So, as you might have guessed, it is pretty important to know how you can get started to create an application using these two frameworks together and how you can implement authentication in ReactJS using JWT. JWT is a web protocol that gets its name because it is based on the exchange of JSON files, which happen also to be called tokens, to provide authentication and authorization features.</p>
